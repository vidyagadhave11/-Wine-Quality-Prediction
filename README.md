# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline to predict wine quality 
using physicochemical properties. The dataset is transformed into a binary classification 
problem:
- GOOD (1) → Quality >= 7
- BAD (0) → Quality < 7

The project compares multiple models, performs hyperparameter tuning, and analyzes feature importance.

6. Feature Scaling
7. Model Training (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree)
8. Model Evaluation
9. Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV)
10. Feature Importance Analysis

---

## 📊 Models Compared

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree (Best Model after tuning)

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/ml_pipeline.py
```

---

## 🏆 Results Summary

- Scaling improved Logistic Regression and KNN
- Decision Tree performed best after tuning
- Alcohol and volatile acidity are key quality indicators
